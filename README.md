This is a simple action that merges these two actions üéâ

- [purcell/setup-emacs](https://github.com/purcell/setup-emacs)
- [jcs090218/setup-emacs-windows](https://github.com/jcs090218/setup-emacs-windows)

This allow us to use Emacs across all operating systems!

## üî® Usage

```yaml
uses: jcs090218/setup-emacs@master
with:
  version: 24.5
```

## ‚ùì What does it solve?

You use to have this,

```yaml
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Install Emacs on Linux/macOS
    - uses: purcell/setup-emacs@master
      if: matrix.os == 'ubuntu-latest' || matrix.os == 'macos-latest'
      with:
        version: ${{ matrix.emacs-version }}

    # Install Emacs on Windows
    - uses: jcs090218/setup-emacs-windows@master
      if: matrix.os == 'windows-latest'
      with:
        version: ${{ matrix.emacs-version }}
```

now you can replace all by this:

```yaml
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Install Emacs on all platforms
    - uses: jcs090218/setup-emacs@master
      with:
        version: ${{ matrix.emacs-version }}
```
